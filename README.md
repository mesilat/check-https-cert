# Check HTTPS Certificate Addon for Confluence

If you are a system administrator with a number of cites under your management, use 'Cert Validity' macro
to print expiration date and time of your SSL certificates. Just specify a host address (and optionally a port number)
and the macro will automatically print the server certificate expiration date.
