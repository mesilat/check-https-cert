# Check HTTPS Certificate Addon for Confluence

If you are a system administrator with a number of cites under your management, use 'Cert Validity' macro
to print expiration date and time of your SSL certificate. Just specify host address (and optionally port number)
and the macro will automatically print the server certificate expiration date.

This addon is available on Atlassian Marketplace:
